Requirements to run

In order to run these files, you will need python installed aswell as installing the logging extension by running 'pip install logging'. If you wish to use the version with the html gui you will also need to install flask,
which can be done through 'pip install flask'.

How the API works 

There are several endpoints for the GUI to interact with the flask

/

/ is the default endpoint and is used to render the template. It is passed the game board as an argument
/move

/move is the endpoint to complete a user move. The endpoint expects a request with 2 arguments x and y which are the users coordinate inputs. There are 3 types of responses, success,failure and finished. For success and failure 
the response has a status which is either 'success'. If success the board will be sent within "board" aswell as the colour of the playerr whos turn it is under "player". If it is returning a fail an error message is provided under "message"

If it is a response to say that the game has finished, then it will have 2 arguments. The first is "finished" and the value of "finished" will be a message which has the reason for the game ending, the number of each colour counter and who won/draw

/save

/save is the endpoint to save the current state of the game to the user. The endpoint expects the request to be in plaintext and the body of the request to be the name the user wants to save the file as. The endpoint will return a response
with the format of "status" which will be success or fail depending on the outcome and a "message" which will either be conformation of the saves completion or an error message of what went wrong.

/load 

/load is the endpoint to load a previously saved game. Like /save tthe /load endpoint expects the request to be in plaintext and the body of the request to be the name of the file the user wants to load. The endpoint will return a response 
with the arguments "status" which will be success or fail depending on if the file was succesfully loaded or not, aswell as a "message" which will be confirmation of a succesful game load or an error message of what went wrong
